Description: # MongoDB Test Util
        
        This library provides a handful of useful functionality for easing the testing
        of systems that rely on MongoDB as a datastore
        
        ## Start and Teardown mongod
        
        For most use cases, you can use this snippet to startup a mongod instance
        for your test environment
        
            from mongo_test import startup_handle
            startup_handle()
        
        To tear an instance down if one exists:
        
            from mongo_test import teardown_handle
            teardown_handle()
        
        ## Fixtures
        
        MongoTest allows you to specify fixtures in yaml, with a few conveniences
        
        i.e.
        
            from mongo_test_util.fixtures import import_data
            import_data([path, ...])
        
        A sample yaml file would look something like:
        
        `user_fixture.yml`
            configuration:
                collection: users
                drop: true
            simple_user:
                _id: !oid 1
